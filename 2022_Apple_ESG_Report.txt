At Apple, we believe the measure of any great innovation is the
positive impact it has on people’s lives. It’s why we work every
day to make our technology an even greater force for good.
Today, our teams around the world infuse Apple’s deeply held values into everything we make. That work can
take many forms. But whether we’re protecting the right to privacy, designing technology that is accessible to
all, or using more recycled material in our products than ever, we are always working to make a difference for
the people we serve and the planet we inhabit.

As a company, we know that our impact on people’s lives reaches beyond the technology we create. And we
apply the same ethos of constant innovation and improvement to every aspect of our work — from building an
inclusive company culture where everyone feels welcome to becoming carbon neutral across our global supply
chain and the lifetime of our products by 2030.

At the heart of our efforts is a steadfast commitment to serving the communities we are a part of. We work
with teachers, advocates, and entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds as part of our Racial Equity and Justice
Initiative. We help create opportunity in communities on the frontlines of climate change through the Restore
Fund, which supports carbon removal and sustainable forestry. And we provide resources and training to
the next generation of innovators through the Apple Developer Academy and educational initiatives across
the globe.

In this report, we are pleased to share our progress, which is a product of collaboration with committed         Tim Cook
partners worldwide. At Apple, we believe that the only way to effectively tackle global challenges is by         CEO
working together, and we are grateful to share this road with so many passionate leaders.

We’re engaged in this work because it’s right — and because we want to leave the world better than we
found it in everything we do. By leading with our values, we hope to be a ripple in the pond that inspires
a far greater change.

At Apple, we’re acting with urgency to protect our planet’s limited resources and to be
a leader in the fight against climate change. Since 2020, we’ve been carbon neutral for
our worldwide operations, and by 2030, we plan to expand that progress to our entire
supply chain and the lifetime use of our products. And today, nearly 20 percent of the
materials in our products were made from recycled content — a number we’re working
to increase.

Across our environmental work, we’re also committed to being a force for equity. We’re
working with communities on the frontlines of climate change and the next generation
of diverse entrepreneurs to create shared opportunity and to build a more just world.

   Climate scenario analysis
   In 2020, we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and
   transition effects of climate change. To align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
   (TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2°C.
   And we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities. The
   analysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our
   corporate resiliency. It also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies,
   including considerations around supply chain diversification, as well as safeguarding our global assets.

   We’re committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change.
   For more information on these climate-related risks and Apple’s governance of these risks, read our
   2021 CDP submission (PDF).

People are at the center of everything we do and every decision we make. While the
pandemic has changed some of the ways we do our work, our values remain the same.
The partnerships we have cultivated over the years throughout our supply chain have
allowed us to continue to make significant progress in upholding the highest standards
of labor and human rights and worker health and safety, and make unprecedented
achievements in climate action and the stewardship of natural resources. Yet, as proud
as we are of our progress, we know each year and each achievement is just a stepping
stone in our continuous pursuit of “better.”

   In calendar year 2021, Apple spent over $7.1 billion with diverse suppliers around the
   world. Our Supplier Diversity program offers support to participating suppliers and
   seeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities. For example,
   supplier development has been a long-standing commitment within Apple’s supply
   chain, which is facilitated internally and externally. Externally, we partner with major
   universities to provide executive development and capacity building to key diverse
   suppliers. And we’re proud to have supported Michigan State University and
   Howard University on creating their first programs for diverse supplier development.

   A highlight of 2021 was that for the first time we engaged diverse suppliers
   in North America in manufacturing accessories for some of Apple’s most well-
   known products.

   We’re also promoting diversity in the companies with which we do business.
   For example, our agreements with our primary construction suppliers require
   the reporting of their efforts to include diverse subcontractors on all Apple-
   related projects.

   As a result of our efforts, we were chosen as Corporation of the Year by the National
   Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) in October 2021. This award is
   NMSDC’s highest honor to a major corporation for the utilization of ethnic minority-
   owned suppliers, specifically those with Asian-Indian, Asian-Pacific, Black,
   Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous owners.                                                                Apple’s $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund will expand access to learning opportunities and skills

At Apple, our North Star is creating technology that empowers people and enriches
their lives. Teams across Apple are always innovating to make technology that’s
even better for our users — that protects their right to privacy, that’s durable and
resilient, and that’s inclusive and accessible for everyone. And wherever we meet
our customers — online, over the phone, or in person — we’re committed to treating
everyone with dignity and respect.

We believe that technology should be a force for good in the world. It’s why we
partner with students and educators using technology to teach and learn in new
ways, and collaborate with doctors and researchers to uncover new insights that help
people live healthier lives. Every day, we work to infuse the technology we make with
the values that define us.

their technology. Whether we’re working with educators, nonprofit leaders, or the global
developer community, we believe in using our technology, our resources, and our voice
to help people make a difference in their communities. We can achieve so much more
when we work together — with our neighbors — to build a better future for all.

   Responding to the war in Ukraine
   We are deeply concerned about the ongoing war in Ukraine and have provided support
   in several ways. We made corporate donations to humanitarian efforts helping people on
   the ground, including to relief agencies and non-profits, such as World Central Kitchen,
   Doctors Without Borders, and the International Rescue Committee. We facilitated
   contributions to UNICEF — which is supporting children and families affected by the
   war — through a tile on our website and services like Apple Music and the App Store.
   We also offered our employees opportunities to donate and volunteer, including holding
   a 2-to-1 matching campaign to amplify employee donations to organizations providing
   shelter, food, and medicine to those affected by the war. Employees also took part in virtual
   activities, including providing language support to refugees, recording video messages
   and making cards for children, and supporting the Missing Maps Project, which helps map
   vulnerable places, like Ukraine, so that NGOs and individuals can use the maps and data to
   better respond to crises. At the same time, we have worked to support our teams in Ukraine
   and across the region. In Ukraine, we contacted every employee, assisting them and their
   families in any way we could. We are also offering support to our Ukrainian team members                    Volunteers from retail participated in a gardening activity that included seeding, weeding, mulching, composting,
