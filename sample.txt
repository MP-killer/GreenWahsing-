DEI Strategy: For Employees,
Customers and Communities
Our comprehensive and company-wide DEI
strategy strongly aligns with our True North Goals
by focusing on three key stakeholder groups:
employees, customers and communities. We all
have a role to play in creating a more equitable and
inclusive world, and look forward to building on the
momentum we created in FY 2021 with our
stakeholders at the center.


Employees
Representation Across All Levels of Intuit

Representation is a key step in creating an inclusive
and equitable environment where all employees
can do the best work of their lives. While we have
made progress in improving representation in our
workforce, we must do more. Without represen­
tation, we cannot deliver for customers and achieve
our mission. In FY 2021, we met our goal for the
representation of women in technology, reaching
30 percent of our technology organization. We saw
positive momentum in our strategy, but trailed
slightly behind our target of 13 percent represen­
tation of underrepresented minorities in our
U.S. workforce.

Equity for Underrepresented Minority Talent

While we dedicated resources to increase representation of underrepresented
minorities at all levels, we acknowledge that we did not meet our annual target
and have more work to do. In partnership with the REAL Team, our Talent
Acquisition Team, people managers and with input from our 13 ERGs, we are
reexamining our hiring, retention, promotion and pay policies and practices to
continue to attract talent from these underrepresented minority groups and
foster more positive employee experiences once they are part of the Intuit
family. This work is well underway.

Intuit’s Employee Resource Groups

Nearly 25 percent of Intuit’s employees globally
participate in ERGs to drive high-impact
programs, contribute to our DEI strategy and
create an inclusive culture. These ERGs create
community among those who identify as a
specific demographic and/or their allies. They
play an important role in building awareness of
cultural diversity, identifying unconscious biases
and initiating important conversations to drive
meaningful change.

Our ERGs played a leading role in creating key
opportunities to cultivate an inclusive environment.
From hosting the Asia Pacific Network fireside
chat and the second annual Trans Summit, to
participating in recruiting efforts and the interview
process while encouraging continued dialogue
among managers and colleagues, these groups are
critical to our strategy.

This year, employees also launched the 13th ERG,
the Indigenous Peoples Network, to create a space
for community among Indigenous employees and
allies. The network has more than 100 inaugural
members and continues to grow.

Customers
Equitable Products and Services

With a strong commitment to ensuring our products are fair and inclusive,
employees across Intuit are working together to create equity across the
company. This spans from our products and services to our marketing and
communications activities, where we’ve created principles to ensure the
diversity of our content reflects our unique customers.

Over the past year, Intuit’s Accessibility and Inclusive Design team transformed
how we build products, support customers and develop an inclusive
workplace. Intuit’s Accessibility Champion program, which builds accessibility
knowledge and disability etiquette capabilities within a cross-functional
group of volunteer employees, grew to include more than 1,000 champions
and 24 product leaders. They continued the important work of embedding
accessibility into our design requirements and code reviews, driving more than
550 product improvements in FY 2021. These champions also shared their
knowledge externally, teaching workshops, providing expertise at events and
volunteering with nearly 40 organizations to give back to communities with
their accessibility knowledge.

fundamentally shifted the way we work and live.

The challenges are clear and the time to act is
now. That’s why Intuit is committed to taking
action to make a difference today. We are actively

Support for the Intuit
Workforce During the Pandemic


Employees
Intuit prioritized protecting our employees and extended
workforce and slowing the spread of COVID-19 as the virus
continued to impact the world. With continued remote working,
Intuit added a number of temporary benefits to ease this
transition and create a safe and inclusive working environment
beginning in March 2020. After our initial response outlined
in the FY 2020 report, and as it became clear this new way of
working would last longer than expected, we continued to
reevaluate our benefits to ensure employees and our extended
workforce received the support they needed.

We refreshed our time-off policy to grant employees a full two
weeks of supplemental sick days, through December 2021. We
introduced the first Recharge Days, pausing work and giving
employees paid time off for an extended time in November and
December 2020 and July 2021. This coordinated, company-wide
                                                                                 Employees at an Intuit office
time off allowed employees to unplug from work, rest
and recharge.

Throughout the year, we expanded resources to support
employee mental well-being, including monthly newsletters,                       “I want to express how enormously grateful I am for
mindfulness tools, trainings and webinars, and guidance on                        Intuit’s continued recognition of the ongoing

Our Response to India’s Pandemic Crisis

At each of our offices globally, Intuit offered flexibility and
timely support throughout the year. However, the resurgence
of COVID-19 in India in Spring 2021 required an intentional and
innovative response to further support employees experiencing
unprecedented challenges. As many of our employees and their
dependents did not have access to vaccines, we partnered with
Columbia Asia Hospital and Parkmed Clinic to open a vaccination
center at our office in Bangalore, India. In addition to covering
vaccines for our employees and their dependents, Intuit extended
vaccine access to interns located in Bangalore, as well as front-
line essential workers and contingent workers employed by our
service partners. Employees and their dependents who were
already vaccinated or unable to participate in the sponsored event
received reimbursement for vaccine costs.

We also made a donation to GiveIndia, a nonprofit organization
helping non-government healthcare organizations to create
COVID care centers, fill gaps in oxygen supply and provide
personal protective equipment to health workers. We offered a 2:1
match for any employee donations to GiveIndia and Happiness
Kit. As COVID-19 continues to be a global health issue, we are
dedicated to providing support to all of our employees in the
months ahead.

Remote Career Possibilities for Underserved Communities

One of the biggest challenges facing our millions of customers
around the globe is having confidence in the financial
decisions they make. Intuit is solving this problem with our
worldwide network of experts who provide one-on-one
support for customers and help them make decisions with
complete confidence. This growing network of remote experts
and support teams, employed both by Intuit and trusted
partners, is a key way we deliver on our mission of powering
prosperity while also creating new career possibilities in
underserved communities.

As we continued to grow this network in FY 2021, we leaned into
the historic success we found in a remote model where talent
could live and work from their homes or whatever location best
fit their unique needs and circumstances. We ramped up our
efforts to build a dispersed expert network and invested $32
million in labor income to create remote jobs in underserved
communities. The evolution to reach more individuals in
underserved communities through these jobs was inspired by
the successful career development programs at our Prosperity
Hubs, communities suffering from economic disparity where we
have created a concentrated number of jobs and economic
impact across eight sites (see page 29). Our expert network is
expansive, and within the network we’ve created 4,260 seasonal
and year-round remote jobs that touch more than 900
underserved communities globally. These roles contribute to
our overall FY 2024 goal of creating jobs for 10,000 individuals
in underserved communities, including those located in
Prosperity Hub communities.

Innovative Solutions for our Customers
Since the founding of the company, we’ve always put customers at the center of
everything we do. Our customers have a universal set of needs. They’re trying
to make ends meet, get out of debt and save money. We’re working to develop
innovative solutions to help our customers meet these challenges, as well as
respond to unexpected hardship and address inequalities.

The pandemic triggered an economic shock that destabilized consumers and
small businesses around the world, creating an urgent situation for many. We
acted with speed and urgency to develop Intuit Aid Assist in FY 2020 and
continued to update and evolve the tool throughout FY 2021. Built using our
platform technology and artificial intelligence (AI), this innovative, free tool
allowed anyone in the U.S. to cut through the maze of requirements and quickly
understand their eligibility for federal small business funding.

In Canada, we launched the Intuit Prosperity Accelerator program, in
partnership with Highline Beta, to support startups focused on solving the
financial challenges facing Canadian consumers and small businesses. The
six-month program paired eight participating startups with Intuit Innovation
Catalysts, dedicated coaches and experts in Intuit’s design thinking process,
Design for Delight, to execute focused pilots. The program helped the
companies better understand their customers, enhance their product offerings
and expand their reach. Of the startups that participated in the program,
75 percent have gone on to accelerate growth by closing funding rounds
and partnerships. Following the success of the inaugural year, we launched
the Intuit Prosperity Accelerator: AI to leverage the power of AI to advance
prosperity across North America.

Increased Access to Create Opportunity for Small Business

Intuit QuickBooks is a global platform of interconnected financial
tools that serves as a source of truth for more than 7 million small
business and self-employed customers globally. Since 2017,
QuickBooks Capital has made it easier for disadvantaged small
businesses in the U.S. to obtain funding by automating much
of the process to access loans. Many of the customers served
by QuickBooks Capital do not qualify for a loan elsewhere. The
program’s sophisticated analysis and machine learning are able
to assess a business’s health and credit worthiness in a way that
gives us an advantage over the traditional processes employed
by banks and other lenders. Throughout FY 2021, refinements
to the risk models enabled the company to expand eligibility to
more than 1.3 million small businesses, and those who applied
through QuickBooks Capital experienced a three-time increase in
approval rates.

Additionally, during the pandemic, eligible QuickBooks
customers in the U.S. were able to apply for the Paycheck
Protection Program (PPP) loans through QuickBooks Capital. To
date, QuickBooks Capital has helped facilitate $1.5 billion in Small
Business Administration-approved PPP loans, helping more than
40,000 of our small business customers, and keeping thousands
of employees on payroll.

Investing in Educational Equity Through
Prosperity Hub School Districts

Today, 33 percent of children worldwide lack
access to remote learning and 50 percent of low-
income students in the U.S. do not have the devices
they need for distance education. Intuit expanded
its Prosperity Hub School District program in FY
2021 through the launch of our Digital Equity
Initiative to address students’ unequal access
to technology and resources to support remote
learning during the pandemic. The program now
includes 21 school districts across nine countries
with a combined enrollment of more than 1.6
million students. Each district was selected based
on two key criteria: economic need and diversity of
the student body. Nearly 80 percent of students in
these districts identify as being underrepresented
minorities. Through the Digital Equity Initiative,
these districts received combined donations of $1.1
million that have been used to purchase devices
like laptops and hotspots, as well as hire additional
teaching staff and IT management. The grants
were also used to fund programs that support
underrepresented minority students like the Centre                                                  “This is humbling and has never happened to us in our

Employees
Last year, Intuit ensured our employees were able
to take advantage of climate-positive programs,
adding sustainability-related expenses, including
purchases like e-bikes, solar panels and more to
its annual Well-Being for Life Program, providing
reimbursements up to $1,000 for all related
expenses. In July 2021, Intuit introduced a partner,
YellowTin, to help U.S.-based employees take the
next step on their sustainability journey. YellowTin,
a national CleanTech company, educates and
empowers homeowners and renters to make
informed decisions about switching to more cost-
effective, electricity-based solutions.

Intuit employees can now calculate their at-home
carbon footprint and receive recommended
solutions to reduce it, ranging from purchasing an
e-bike for their commute to installing solar panels
to supply their home electricity. In FY 2022, this
benefit will increase to $1,300 for all employees to
further invest in their well-being, in a manner that
suits them best.
